This application/site was created as a submission to a [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/3column-preview-card-component-pH92eAR2-) was to build an application to complete the given user stories.

The challenge is to build out this 3-column preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
